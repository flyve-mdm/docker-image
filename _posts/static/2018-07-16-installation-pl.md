## Get the Docker Environment

To start with the installation process, we must get the [Flyve MDM Docker Environment](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/docker-environment) from its source.

- Using git, clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/flyve-mdm/docker-environment.git```
- [Download the project from GitHub](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/docker-environment/archive/develop.zip)
- [From GitHub Releases](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/docker-environment/releases)

Then, we follow these easy steps:

### If you're on Linux or Mac OS

#### 1. Enter into docker directory

After we get the project, we enter into the docker directory located in the root of the project.

#### 2. Configure the hosts file

In this part, we have to modify the host file in our host machine. This file is in the route ```/etc/hosts```.

Then, we add the host in a new line:

```172.26.0.31 www.dev.glpi.local```

Where, the parameters are:

    [ip_address_web] [host_name]

    ip_address_web             internal ip address of the Apache container
    host_name                  server_name defined in the .env file

#### 3. Configure your Fork source

In the documentation to [contribute to Flyve MDM GLPI Plugin](https://github.com/flyve-mdm/glpi-plugin/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md), we recommend to create a fork from the Flyve MDM repository. After this, we need to set the  *FLYVEMDMSOURCE* variable in the *.env* file, writing the source of this fork.

    FLYVEMDM_SOURCE=git@github.com:<your_username>/glpi-plugin.git

<img src="{{ '/images/picto-information.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Good to know:" height="16px"/> We must remember that before this step, it must be ready the configuration of the SSH keys corresponding to your Github account.

#### 4. Build and start the containers

Now execute the command to build the docker environment in the terminal:

```user@localhost:docker-image-feature-add-containers $ docker-compose up --build```

This process download the images, build the containers, execute the configuration, create the network interface and start running all containers.

#### 5. Open the browser

Open the browser and enter the server_name added in the previous step.

    http://www.dev.glpi.local

#### 6. Configure GLPI

If it's the first time you use GLPI, it will display the installation wizard screen.
We must follow the installation steps and to configure the database host, we have to enter this information:

```console

    SQL server (MariaDB or MySQL): glpi-dbmysql
                         SQL user: docker
                     SQL Password: docker

```

Where the parameters are:

    SQL server (MariaDB or MySQL)             the host container MYSQL
    SQL user                                  database user defined in the environment
    SQL Password                              database password set in the *.env* file

### If you are on Windows OS

#### 1. Enter in docker directory

After we get the project, we enter into the docker directory located in the root of the project.

#### 2. Configure the hosts file

Before continuing, we must  know the local ip_address of the host network. In the cmd console, we must enter the command **ipconfig** and copy the local ip_address.

In this part, we have to modify the hosts file in our host machine. This file is in the route ```C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts```

Then, we add the host in a new line like this example:

```192.168.0.100 www.dev.glpi.local```

Where, the parameters are:

    [ip_address_web] [host_name]

    ip_address_web             local ip address of the host machine
    host_name                  server_name defined in the .env file.

                         SQL user: docker
                     SQL Password: docker

```

Where the parameters are:

    SQL server (MariaDB or MySQL)             the host container MYSQL
    SQL user                                  database user defined in the environment
    SQL Password                              database password set in the *.env* file
